MyFastBoot Buildroot
====================

This repository customises Buildroot 2025.11-rc1 to prototype an ultra-fast
boot stack for MyFastBoot. Two build profiles are maintained:

* **QEMU fast boot harness** – minimal rootfs for functional testing under
	emulation.
* **Raspberry Pi 4 target** – hardware-focused image using the Bootlin
	external aarch64 glibc toolchain and lightweight `fastfb` framebuffer app.

Both variants share the same `fastfb` userspace program and rootfs overlay
(`board/myfastboot/rootfs-overlay/`) that launches the demo directly from the
init process.

Quick Start
-----------

*Requirements*: WSL/Ubuntu environment, standard `/usr/bin:/bin` toolchain,
~25 GB free disk space.

Buildroot outputs are isolated per profile: `output/qemu/` (QEMU initrd),
`output/pi4/` (Raspberry Pi images), and `output/ros2/` (shared ROS 2
filesystem). When you rebuild the ROS 2 data volume it now lands in
`output/ros2/images/ros2.ext4` and the helper script fans out copies into
`output/qemu/images/` and `output/pi4/images/` so both profiles stay in
sync.

### QEMU profile

1. Rebuild the fast-boot initrd:

	```sh
	./rebuild_rootfs.sh
	```

2. (Optional, recommended) Refresh the shared ROS 2 data volume:

	```sh
	./rebuild_ros2_volume.sh
	```

3. Launch the emulator:

	```sh
	./run_qemu.sh
	```

If `ros2.ext4` is present in `output/qemu/images/`, QEMU maps it as `/dev/vda`
and PID 1 mounts it to `/mnt/ros2` while `fastfb` paints the splash (currently
~5 s from VM start). Artifacts live under `output/qemu/images/` (e.g. `Image`,
`rootfs.cpio.gz`, `ros2.ext4`).

### Raspberry Pi 4 profile

```sh
./rebuild_ros2_volume.sh   # optional, run first to embed ROS 2 data
./rebuild_pi4.sh
```

The helper script applies `configs/myfastboot_rpi4_defconfig`, performs the
full Buildroot build, and produces deployable artifacts in
`output/pi4/images/` (notably `sdcard.img`, `boot.vfat`, `rootfs.ext2`,
`ros2.ext4`). Flash `sdcard.img` to an
SD card (e.g. with `dd` or Raspberry Pi Imager) and boot on a Pi 4. Expect
roughly 8–12 s from power-on to the framebuffer splash on a fast UHS-I card,
with realistic optimisation ceiling around 2–3 s without bypassing the stock
Pi firmware.

If you rebuild the ROS 2 volume, rerun `./rebuild_pi4.sh` so the post-image
step can roll the refreshed `ros2.ext4`—copied for you into
`output/pi4/images/`—into `sdcard.img`.

Features & Components
---------------------

* `configs/my_defconfig` – QEMU Stage 0 initrd with BusyBox + `fastfb`.
* `configs/myfastboot_ros2_defconfig` – Stage 1 ROS 2 filesystem image built
 	as a standalone ext4 volume.
* `configs/myfastboot_rpi4_defconfig` – Raspberry Pi 4 board support wired to
 	the Bootlin external toolchain.
* `board/myfastboot/pi4/cmdline.txt` – trimmed kernel command line forcing
 	`/init` execution of `fastfb`.
* `board/myfastboot/pi4/post-image.sh` – wraps the Raspberry Pi tooling to add
	the optional `ros2.ext4` partition to the SD image.
* `package/fastfb/` – lightweight C framebuffer demo built as the sole
 	userspace application.
* `board/myfastboot/rootfs-overlay/init` – BusyBox init script that mounts
 	pseudo filesystems, boots the GUI, and asynchronously attaches the ROS 2
 	volume at `/mnt/ros2` (flagged via `/run/ros2.ready`).
* `board/myfastboot/ros2-overlay/` – seed content copied into the ROS 2 volume
 	(e.g. `opt/ros2`).

Reproducibility Helpers
-----------------------

* `rebuild_rootfs.sh` – rebuild + launch the QEMU profile end-to-end.
* `rebuild_ros2_volume.sh` – create / refresh the ROS 2 ext4 volume used by
 	QEMU and Raspberry Pi builds alike.
* `rebuild_pi4.sh` – configure and rebuild the Raspberry Pi 4 image.
* `run_qemu.sh` – emulation harness that auto-attaches `ros2.ext4` when ready,
  using artifacts from `output/qemu/images/`.

Two-Stage Filesystem Layout
---------------------------

Stage 0 (initrd) stays tiny so that `fastfb` launches quickly. Once `/dev/vda`
appears the init script mounts Stage 1 read-only under `/mnt/ros2` and exports
`ROS2_ROOT`. Applications can watch `/run/ros2.ready` before starting ROS 2
nodes. The Raspberry Pi post-image script consumes
`output/pi4/images/ros2.ext4`—kept in sync by `./rebuild_ros2_volume.sh`—and adds
it as a third partition on the SD card, mirroring the QEMU layout.

Boot Optimisation Notes
-----------------------

We are actively exploring module trimming, firmware tweaks, and init stream
lining. Early Pi 4 targets converge toward: firmware (~700 ms), kernel
decompression + init (~1.0–1.5 s), userspace handoff (~0.5 s). Further
reductions require aggressive kernel pruning, fast storage, and potentially
custom bootloader paths.

Kiosk & OTA Roadmap
-------------------

Next hardware milestone is a Raspberry Pi 4 kiosk driving a 27" HDMI panel in
full-screen mode while remaining field-updatable. The kiosk workload continues
to lean on the minimal Stage 0 image, but the display pipeline must target the
panel native mode (likely 1920×1080 or 2560×1440 @ 60 Hz) and lock the session
down so the framebuffer app (or a future Wayland/browser client) owns the
screen. In parallel we need an over-the-air flow so updated images or ROS
content can be pushed remotely without SD card swaps.

TODO
----

- Confirm the 27" monitor EDID, then extend `board/myfastboot/pi4/cmdline.txt`
	and `rpi-firmware/config.txt` with explicit HDMI timing overrides so the
	framebuffer always boots at the panel native resolution.
- Update `fastfb` (or replace it with a Wayland/browser kiosk shell) to scale
	correctly at 1080p+/landscape, hide the console, and auto-restart if the
	process dies.
- Add a Buildroot package layer for the kiosk app assets so refreshed branding
	can be delivered in the Stage 1 ROS volume without touching the initrd.
- Evaluate OTA tooling (RAUC, SWUpdate, or Buildroot’s built-in Mender
	integration) and prototype dual-rootfs or image streaming that fits the
	current partition map.
- Stand up a remote update server plus signing keys, then script an
	`update-client` service in the rootfs overlay to poll, download, and apply
	signed bundles.
- Document the field update workflow end to end, covering rollback triggers,
	monitoring hooks, and how ROS content syncs with system-level updates.
